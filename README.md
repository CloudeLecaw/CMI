# Welcome to 1MB CMI!

This repository has a few purposes. 

 - Outdated backup to fall back on.
 - Share configurations with our 1MB team members (and you)
 - Show others examples of how I run CMI sometimes.
 - Share a select few 1MB CMI add-ons with the public.

Note: I think it's fair to point out a few things

- No, this does not come with the CMI jar, you still have you buy that yourself.
- No, this is not a complete copy of our live servers, these are select files.
- No, these are not default files, they're (recently) outdated copies.
- Yes, you can open a New Issue to request an update on a specific file.
- And no, this is not the repository to ask for CMI customer support.

Oh yeah, and always make a backup of your data before making any changes.


## Files

The most common reason you're perhaps here are some of these add-ons or files

- The 1MoreBlock.com CMI Add-on called "emotes" can be found here.
- The 1MoreBlock.com CMI Add-on called "finduser" can be found here.
- The 1MoreBlock.com CMI Add-on called "placeholders" can be found here.
- The 1MoreBlock.com CMI Custom Alias "commands" can be found here.
- The 1MoreBlock.com CMI Materials and Item "worth" can be found here.

Quick links to other common CMI files are these

- Alias.yml (live, all false, all true)
- config.yml (live)
- CustomAlias.yml (live)
- eventCommands.yml (live)
- Modules.yml (live, all false, all true)
- ranks.yml (live)
- schedules.yml (live)
- tabList.yml (live)
- worth.yml (live, does not have 1.16.1 items yet, probably unbalanced)

And if you came here to find examples of the 1MB CMI CustomText/ files

- rules.txt (handy for /rules)
- welcomeMessage.txt (handy for /motd (and onJoin msg)) 
- placeholders.txt (1MB CMI add-on for 1MB team command)
- donate.txt (handy for /donate)

## How to use any of this?

As things get created in this github repository, I am sure we will make an attempt at some Wiki pages with extended information. Please check those first before you blindly take a file and assume everything will be fine.

Oh, and of course backup your data before you make any changes to anything.

Basically, these are the easiest steps to use any of these files.

- Backup your existing data, clone your live-server, and change the port of it. Then remove certain things like Discord or Voting plugins. Then in CMI's config.yml set the Maintenance to true, and in the server.properties file turn on whitelist. 
- Get the file you want, and go through it for the reasons you believe you need it. Either specifically copy/paste something from it to your existing file. Or just completely replace it. This really 100% depends on the file in question and why you want to use any of the files we offer on this repository. 
- Start your cloned server, and test. Does all the old stuff still work as expected, are the changes you've made working?
- If everything is fine (otherwise fix it), then make those changes to your live server.

**TLDR;** Get the file you want, use it (partially), test it all first.

## What version?

1MB CMI Project version 0.0.1, for live-1mb-2.8.1-mc-1.16.1

Today it is July 20th, 2020. And the `1MoreBlock.com:25565` Minecraft Survival server is marked: `live-1mb-2.8.1-mc-1.16.1`
```
-live- (live server)
-1MB- (1moreblock linked to network hub called 1mb)
-2.8.1- (1MB version 2.8.1, network version)
-mc- (Minecraft, but it is Spigot jar at the moment)
-1.16.1- (Minecraft version 1.16.1)
```
**TLDR;** These files are for 1.16.x and probably any CMI version that works with 1.16.x

## Youtube videos

Just throwing this in here, but I've made some 1MB CMI Youtube videos as well. They're probably not of any quality, they're probably outdated, but, I made an effort and people ask me for the link every once in a while.
