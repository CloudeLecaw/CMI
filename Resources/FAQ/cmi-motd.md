**CMI can handle the MOTD things**, this is the recommended setup that works well with other plugins on Spigot/Paper 1.16.4 for a message of the day.
- Buy and Install CMI (<https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/3742/>)
- Start using CMI as Chat Manager, if you were using something else.
- Update `config.yml` (see below)
```yaml
# CMI config.yml, find:
  motd:
And change that section to this:
  motd:
    Cmds:
    - cmi ctext welcomeMessage
```
Next, inside the `plugins/CMI/CustomText/` directory make a file called `welcomeMessage.txt`, below is an example of some basic text:
```yaml
&3 Zrips Server Â»&b %server_online%/%server_max_players%&7 players: %onlineplayers_displaynames%
```
Of course, you can use the CMI Custom Text features to expand, using pagination, placeholders, clickable events, etc.

Note that this should work out of the box if you have your CMI Chat configured. New and existing members will both see this welcome message when they join your server.

If you want to give first-time players something extra, you can customize the `eventCommands.yml` file at this section: (for example, you can make another .txt file or do whatever)
```yaml
firstJoinServer:
  Enabled: false
  Commands:
```

Optionally, you can make a `/motd` command. A lot of servers have it, this way players can pull up the message again later. To achieve this go in-game and create a new custom alias using: `/cmi aliaseditor` and click the green `+` to add a new command, type in the name `motd` and press enter. Then click on the new green `+` to add a command, which should be: `cmi ctext welcomeMessage`.

Okay, and finally, the above is for when a player has joined the server. Below is the motd outside of the game. 

In the Minecraft Client players can add your server and see it in their list of servers. This also has a message of the day. If you want to use CMI to set this message you can do so with the command:
`/cmi setmotd &6hi \n &9welcome back`
