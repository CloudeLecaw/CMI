# :star: 1MoreBlock.com CMI Add-on

## Emotes

This is a `CustomAlias.yml` add-on made by Floris, for CMI 8.7.3.x or newer and Minecraft 1.16.1. 

1MB Emotes allows a server owner to offer a set of creative and fun emotes to their players. And using CMI's built-in `/cmi aliaseditor`, these can be customized on the fly (without having to reload the plugin or restart the server).

An emote is a way for a player to express themselves in the chat (or on the server) to others. A much more fun way than typing a smiley sometimes.

Using CMI's particles, sounds, and many other commands from in-game chat, to title messages, bossbar msgs, and what not. Every emote can be cute, quirky, subtle to very 'in your face'.

And yes, cooldowns are possible, again, you can customize every emote in-game. 

Final note: By default the permissions are set to true, and required to get added to the group(s). A quick search/replace on the .yml file before applying it to your server will allow you to mass turn off permissions and enable them all. Generally a permisson for any of the provided commands will be `cmi.customalias.[emote]` So `/welcome` will be `cmi.customalias.welcome`. 

Okay, **let's get started**. Thank you for being interested in this little add-on.

Prequisites. Make sure your Spigot or Paper jar is up to date, as well as CMI. And of course back-up everything before making changes. 

## Download Instructions

Get the .yml file and open it in your favourite YAML editor. Such as Notepad++ on Windows or Sublime Text 3 on macOS. You cannot use regular notepad.

## Installation Instructions

After some intial customizing or perhaps stripping all the permission requirements, you could delete the emotes you don't wish to use. 

Then select everything you want to use, and copy it to your clipboard. 

Now open CMI's plugins/customAlias.yml file and go all the way to the bottom. On a new line riiiight below the last line, paste your clipboard and you should see them all neatly there. Matching exactly how other commands are listed. Indentation should be perfect.

Save the file, and on your server type: /cmi reload. 

Optional step, you can now start adding the CMI custom alias emotes permissions to the appropriate groups.
